# Driving-school-system
This is a project i am working on for a driving school. I am putting the template for the moment so there is no use of the database and only the admin  is functionnal. Additionnal work should be made on the backend and frontend for the Users : Student and Secretary. To test the code run the main file in the src repo using the command :
```
go run main.go
```
On the browser visit : 
```
http://localhost:8080
```
